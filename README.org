* README
This is a repo meant to hold any programs that I have been working on for my current research projects, such that I can fluently transfer the files back and forth between my main machine and my laptop, instead of having to email stuff back and forth
** Current Projects
This repo does not currently have a lot of important contents, but so far there is:
- Mie Theory: Project with Dr. Z
  - Analysis of resonance peaks found in a absorbance, computational program
  - Paper is to be released, currently in preprint
- Arnold Density of States: Program possibly to be used with Dr. Z
  - Used in the singularity region of BCS Theory
- PCT Tunneling Program
- GPU Parton Distribution functions with Dr. Sullivan
  - Adapting the CTEQ 18 program to use CUDA as opposed to solely using FORTRAN
