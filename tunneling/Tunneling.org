* Comprehensive guide to How to use the program
1. Just start with a CSV of your data
2. Open up the drawers on the top until you get to Statistics
3. Right click on statistics, click on import wizard to import data:
   - Choose your CSV file in the first box
     - MAKE SURE YOUR CSV HAS TWO COLUMNS WITH THE FOLLOWING INFO
     - Row 0: Quantities, for example:
       |---------+---------+------|
       | Voltage | Current | dIdV |
       |---------+---------+------|
     - Row 1: Units for the avove quantities for example:
       |----+----+---|
       | mV | mA | S |
       |----+----+---|
     - Overall you should have:
       |---------+---------+------|
       | Voltage | Current | dIdV |
       | mV      | mA      | S    |
       |---------+---------+------|
   - In the delimeter section, choose comma
   - Check the three boxes on the right hand side that tell where the headers are
     - The first two should be 0
     - Unit Row Should be 1
   - There will be a section of two rows that should show your quantity and unit row
     - If something in the first row is red, right click on them and choose the correct quantity (Voltage/Current/dIdV)
     - If something in the second row is red, right click on them and choose the correct unit, probably one of (mV,mA,S)
4. Check that the data is what is expected:
   - Click into statistics, then the name of the imported file, and the various quantities should appear
5. Select =dIdV= and under the plot, below the left edge of the x-axis, there should be a plus sign, click it
6. Now there should be a section called *Analysis Data* where you can again locate =dIdV=, right click on it and select *Fit dIdV* from the menu
   - In the fit Dialog you have many options, but before anything is done, change the following:
     - If $\gamma=0$ change it to be something above zero, 0.01 is standard
     - By default, the temperature (located on the botto) is 0, change it to the known temperature.
   - Choose the correct fit type based on the data, by default it is BTK, the other options are:
     - BTK
     - BCS
     - SIN s-wave
     - SIN d-wave
     - SIS s-wave
     - SIS d-wave
     - And a few more
   - Adjust fit parameters until the data matches the fit
