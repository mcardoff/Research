* Meeting on 9 Jul 2020
** DONE Changes to program
- [X] Change number of points used
  - variable: npoints
- [X] change particle size
  - variable: a or R
- [X] change series terms
  - variable: nmax
- [X] Change material to Nb
  - Involves interpolation, maybe try something else
** Tunneling Program Notes
- Data is in specific formatted text file
  - Import from File -> Import Data
  - Import data to Statistics (C-i)
- Right click on data file under analysis data
  - Click blank plus below the right side of graph to add analysis data
  - Open fit didv
    - CHANGE from BTK
    - SIS d-wave most often
      - Super interacting with super
    - SIN d-Wave as well
      - Super interacting with normal
  - Vmax sets x axis range
  - Do not put gamma to 0
  - Gamma inc/mie theory/finalimgs/reases height of peaks
  - Delta broadens width
  - Name : PCT Analysis v3

** Tunneling Program Notes
Comprehensive guide to How to use the program
- Just start with a CSV of your data
- Open up the drawers on the top until you get to Statistics
- Right click on statistics, click on import wizard to import data:
  - Choose your CSV file in the first box
    - MAKE SURE YOUR CSV HAS TWO COLUMNS WITH THE FOLLOWING INFO
    - Row 0: Quantities, for example:
      | Voltage | Current | dIdV |
    - Row 1: Units for the avove quantities for example:
      | mV | mA | S |
    - Overall you should have:
      | Voltage | Current | dIdV |
      | mV      | mA      | S    |
  - In the delimeter section, choose comma
  - Check the three boxes on the right hand side that tell where the headers are
    - The first two should be 0
    - Unit Row Should be 1
  - There will be a section of two rows that should show your quantity and unit row
    - If something in the first row is red, right click on them and choose the correct quantity (Voltage/Current/dIdV)
    - If something in the second row is red, right click on them and choose the correct unit, probably one of (mV,mA,S)
- Check that the data is what is expected:
  - Click into statistics, then the name of the imported file, and the various quantities should appear
- Select =dIdV= and under the plot, below the left edge of the x-axis, there should be a plus sign, click it
- Now there should be a section called *Analysis Data* where you can again locate =dIdV=, right click on it and select *Fit dIdV* from the menu
  - In the fit Dialog you have many options, but before anything is done, change the following:
    - If $\gamma=0$ change it to be something above zero, 0.01 is standard
    - By default, the temperature (located on the botto) is 0, change it to the known temperature.
  - Choose the correct fit type based on the data, by default it is BTK, the other options are:
    - BTK
    - BCS
    - SIN s-wave
    - SIN d-wave
    - SIS s-wave
    - SIS d-wave
    - And a few more
  - Adjust fit parameters until the data matches the fit
